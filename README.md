# Machine-Translation
A Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model is built to translate human readable dates into machine readable dates using an attention model.The model built here could be used to translate from one language to another, such as translating from English to Hindi. However, language translation requires massive datasets and usually takes days of training on GPUs. To experiment with these models even without using massive datasets,a simpler "date translation" task is carried out.
